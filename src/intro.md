# Intro

If you're already familiar with geospatial technology but new to the Rust programming language, the path of your life has led you here: the right place to get started. This set of examples will introduce you to [GeoRust](https://github.com/georust/) and help you navigate some familiar problems using a powerful programming language that may not quite be familiar to you yet.

Whether you are interested in Rust for its performance or security, integrating geospatial data with Rust is a natural combination.

Nobody likes to be lost for long; Rust is extremely fast. For more than a thousand years, maps have acted as a form of shared memory to safely access stored locations; Rust can help you ensure that shared map locations stored in memory are also [accessed safely](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/meet-safe-and-unsafe.html). People really love discovering new places; people also [really love Rust](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted).

So feel free to [install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started); make yourself a latte (but leave the Java behind); pick any topic on the left; and follow the Coordinate Reference System of your own heart as we dive headfirst into the various GeoRust libraries and explore how they work together.
